trigger_switcher
================

Arduino Code to multiplex a single trigger through a series of digital lines.

`blink_switch` and `led_and_serial` are early drafts of getting the logic working.  `passthru` is the final code we'll be using.

We're using a teensy 2.0++ board, and the PCB files are for Eagle.
